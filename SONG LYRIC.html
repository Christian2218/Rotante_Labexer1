    <h1>Line Without a Hook</h1>
    
        
<P> I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me<br>
When we're alone<br> 
You can hold my hand <br>
If no one's home <br>
Do you like it when I'm away? <br>
If I went and hurt my body, baby <br>
Would you love me the same? <br>
I can feel all my bones coming back <br>
And I'm craving motion <br>
Mama never really learned how to live by herself <br>
<P> It's a curse <br>
And it's growing<br>
You're a pond and I'm an ocean<br>
Oh, all my emotions<br>
Feel like explosions when you are around<br>
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh<br>
<P> Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
I need you here to stay<br>
I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
Crying at the lake<br>
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?<br>
Oh, and if I could take it all back<br>
I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
<p> Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
I said no, I said no<br>
Listen close, it's a no<br>
The wind is a-pounding on my back<br>
And I found hope in a heart attack<br>
Oh, at last, it is past<br>
Now I've got it, and you can't have it<br>
<p> Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
I need you here to stay<br>
I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
Crying at the lake<br>
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh<br>
And if I could take it all back<br>
I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
<p> Darling, when I'm fast asleep<br>
I've seen this person watching me<br>
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"<br>
<p> 'Cause there is something, and there is nothing <br>
There is nothing in between<br>
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer<br>
Watching over me, he's singing<br>
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"<br>
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"<br>
<p> Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
I need you here to stay<br>
Broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
Crying at the lake<br>
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh<br>
And if I could take it all back<br>
I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
